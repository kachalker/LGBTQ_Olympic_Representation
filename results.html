        <h2 class="results-h2">Research Questions</h2>
        <p class="results-p">&emsp;Through this project, I attempted to discern what factors affect the participation and success of LGBTQ+ athletes in the Olympics. I examined factors such as how the athletes’ home countries’ and the Olympic host countries’ overall attitude towards the LGBTQ+ community affects LGBTQ+ participation, what sports LGBTQ+ athletes compete in most, the trends of the number of LGBTQ+ Olympians over the years, and how host countries’ attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community affect LGBTQ+ athletes’ success in Olympics held in that country.</p>

        <h2 class="results-h2">Creation of Datasets and Potential Inaccuracies</h2>
        <p class="results-p">&emsp;I created two datasets to answer this question. My first dataset included every LGBTQ+ Olympians’ name, their home country, the country and year of the Olympics they competed in, and the medals they won. For this dataset, I used data gathered by Tony Scupham-Bilton and rewrote it to fit my needs. My second dataset included every country’s population and a 0-100 rating created by Equaldex that demonstrates the rights and protections afforded to the LGBTQ+ community in each country, called an equality index. I used the population data and equality index data without making any changes, but Tony Scupham-Bilton’s data also included LGBTQ+ Olympic coaches, which I left out of my dataset because I was only interested in the LGBTQ+ athletes themselves. Although Scupham-Bilton was meticulous about gathering his data, he admits that it is impossible to ensure it is one-hundred percent accurate because not every LGBTQ+ Olympian is out.</p>

        <h2 class="results-h2">Conclusions</h2>
        <p class="results-p">&emsp;By examining the visualizations I have created, there are various conclusions you can draw from them about what factors affect the participation and success of LGBTQ+ athletes in the Olympics. The first conclusion is that every year since the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympics began to happen two years apart in 1992, the Winter Olympics have had less than a third of the number of LGBTQ+ participants that the Summer Olympics have had. This disparity is even greater during recent years; the 2018 Winter Olympics only had seventeen LGBTQ+ athletes competed, whereas, in the 2020 Summer Olympics, one hundred eighty-three LGBTQ+ athletes competed. However, nothing about the Winter Olympics makes LGBTQ+ athletes less likely to compete. Instead, the lack of LGBTQ+ participation in the Winter Olympics is because the Summer Olympics have almost five times the number of athletes competing in them than the Winter Olympics do. Even though there were much fewer LGBTQ+ athletes competing in the Winter Olympics, figure skating and ice hockey, two winter sports, were the fourth and fifth most common sports that LGBTQ+ Olympians competed in. The other three sports to fill out the top five were all summer sports: football, basketball, and swimming.</p>

        <p class="results-p">&emsp;The visualizations also showcased that a home country’s overall attitude towards the LGBTQ+ community does affect their number of LGBTQ+ Olympians. Although every country with a high equality index did not also have a high number of  LGBTQ+ Olympians, such as Greenland with an Equality Index of ninety-eight and zero LGBTQ+ Olympians, every country with a low Equality Index had zero LGBTQ+ Olympians. This is significant because it showcases that countries like China and Russia, which bring a relatively large group of athletes to the Olympics, have zero LGBTQ+ Olympians because of their negative societal attitudes and oppression towards the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

        <p class="results-p">&emsp;Although a home country’s overall attitude towards the LGBTQ+ community does affect their number of LGBTQ+ Olympians, my visualizations showed that an Olympics’ host country has minimal effect on the number of LGBTQ+ athletes that compete. The number of LGBTQ+ athletes competing in host countries with low Equality Indexes was not significantly different from the number of LGBTQ+ athletes competing in countries with high Equality Indexes. For example, the United States has had fewer LGBTQ+ athletes compete in their Olympics than China has had, even though the United States has a much higher Equality Index than China. Furthermore, Japan, the host country with the highest amount of LGBTQ+ athletes competing in their Olympics, has a relatively low Equality Index of fifty-eight. Instead of the host country affecting the number of LGBTQ+ athletes competing in a particular Olympics, the improving treatment of the LGBTQ+ community over the years appears to be the most significant contributing factor since there has been a steady increase of LGBTQ+ Olympians over time.</p>

        <p class="results-p">&emsp;Even though a host country’s attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community have minimal effect on the number of LGBTQ+ athletes that compete, the host country does affect the success of Olympians there. For example, LGBTQ+ athletes won fifteen more medals in the United States than in China despite China having more LGBTQ+ athletes competing. A similar thing is also seen between Japan and Brazil. Japan had over forty more athletes compete in their Olympics, but LGBTQ+ Olympians only won three fewer medals in Brazil than in Japan.</p>

        <h1 class="results-h2">Implications of These Findings</h1>
        <p class="results-p">&emsp;Researchers of Human Rights Studies and Women’s Gender and Sexuality Studies have long argued that the Olympics have not taken the proper steps to ensure that LGBTQ+ Olympians are given fair chances to compete. These scholars argue that by consistently choosing countries who oppress the LGBTQ+ community, such as China who was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, the IOC is hindering LGBTQ+ athletes’ ability to compete by allowing their “human rights [to be] broadly trampled upon,”<sup>1</sup> but it is difficult for scholars to prove this because “LGBT sport history is vastly underresearched.”<sup>2</sup> However, the research done in this project can help advance these conversations because it demonstrates that countries’ views of the LGBTQ+ community do negatively affect LGBTQ+ Olympians. The data I have included in this dataset could be further expounded upon to make even more specific connections to demonstrate the effect of a country’s attitudes about the LGBTQ+ community have on LGBTQ+ Olympians’ participation and success by exploring if a country’s expansion of gay rights, such as the decriminalizing of homosexuality, directly affects the number of LGBTQ+ Olympians from that country and the success of those who are competing in that country.</p>
